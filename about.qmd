### Hello!

I'm James Ashmore, the creator of Bioinformer.

My goal is to share insights and experiences from the bioinformatics field. In my free time, I enjoy playing the electric guitar, Warhammer, and Arkham horror boardgames. Through Bioinformer, I aim to make scientific concepts engaging and accessible to everyone, from experts to curious minds, in the field of computational life sciences.
